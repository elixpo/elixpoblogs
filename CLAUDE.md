# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Dev server on port 3000
npm run build            # Build for Cloudflare Pages (via @cloudflare/next-on-pages)
npm run preview          # Local Cloudflare Pages preview (wrangler)
npm run deploy           # Build + deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npm run db:migrate       # Run D1 migrations (remote)
```

No test or lint commands are configured.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Editor**: BlockNote 0.47 with custom blocks (image, equations, AI, mentions, tabs, TOC)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages via `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) — accessed via `getRequestContext().env.DB`
- **Media**: Cloudinary (upload/delete via `/api/media/upload`)
- **Auth**: Elixpo Accounts OAuth 2.0 — session in httpOnly cookie (`lixblogs_session`)
- **AI**: LixSearch (search.elixpo.com) — session-based SSE streaming, proxied through `/api/ai/*`
- **KV**: Cloudflare KV namespace bound in wrangler.toml

## Architecture

### Directory Layout

- `app/` — Next.js App Router: pages, layouts, API routes
- `src/components/` — React components, especially `Editor/` (BlockNote editor with 20+ files)
- `src/pages/` — Page-level components imported by `app/` pages (migration artifact from Vite)
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` — Auth state via React Context (no Redux/Zustand)
- `src/ai/` — Client-side AI module: `agent.js` (lixsearch SSE streaming + session management), `prompts.js` (system prompts)
- `src/styles/` — CSS files organized by feature
- `lib/` — Server-side utilities: `auth.js`, `cloudinary.js`, `aiRateLimit.js`, `tiers.js`
- `migrations/` — D1 SQL migration files

### Key Patterns

**App Router pages are thin wrappers** — they import full page components from `src/pages/`. Example: `app/new-blog/page.jsx` renders `src/pages/WritePage.jsx`.

**Auth flow**: OAuth redirect → `/api/auth/callback` exchanges code for tokens, upserts user in D1, sets session cookie → new users go to `/intro`, returning users to `/`. Middleware protects `/settings`, `/new-blog`, `/intro`.

**Editor architecture**: `BlogEditor.jsx` is the core — uses BlockNote with a custom schema (`src/components/Editor/schema.js`). AI features: space on empty line opens AI command menu, text selection shows AI edit toolbar. AI uses LixSearch session-based SSE streaming — each blog gets a persistent `ai_session_id` for conversation memory. Text streams as markdown, parsed to blocks in real-time. Images are generated inline by LixSearch and delivered as URLs in the stream. The sparkle cursor (`ai-glob-cursor`) follows text blocks only (skips image blocks).

**Image blocks** (`BlogImageBlock.jsx`): Three modes — upload, embed URL, AI generate. When AI generates an image, LixSearch signals `<TASK>Generating image</TASK>` in the SSE stream, and the editor inserts a skeleton placeholder. The image URL arrives as `![alt](url)` in the RESPONSE stream and populates the block.

**Media uploads** go through `/api/media/upload` → Cloudinary. Tier-based storage limits enforced server-side. Images are compressed client-side to WebP before upload (`src/utils/compressImage.js`).

**AI rate limiting**: `lib/aiRateLimit.js` checks daily usage against tier limits (free: 15/day, member: 50/day). Usage tracked in D1 `users` table (`ai_usage_today`, `ai_usage_date`).

### D1 Access

D1 is only available in Cloudflare runtime. In local dev, `getRequestContext().env.DB` may be unavailable — API routes handle this gracefully with try/catch fallbacks.

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ELIXPO_CLIENT_ID` / `ELIXPO_CLIENT_SECRET` — OAuth
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` — Base URL (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` / `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` — Media
- AI is powered by LixSearch (search.elixpo.com) — no API keys needed (domain whitelisted)
- D1 and KV configured in `wrangler.toml`

### Path Alias

`@/*` resolves to `src/*` (configured in tsconfig.json).

# LixBlogs — Platform Architecture Plan

## Overview

LixBlogs is a blogging platform built with **Next.js** (Cloudflare Pages), **Cloudflare Workers** (API), **D1** (database), **KV/Cache** (caching), and **R2** (media storage). Authentication is handled via **Elixpo Accounts OAuth 2.0** (see `login_plan.md`).

---

## 1. User & Organization Model

### Personal Accounts
- Every user has one personal account tied to their Elixpo Accounts identity
- Personal profile: display name, username (from Elixpo Accounts), bio, avatar (R2), banner (R2)
- Each user can **create multiple organizations**
- Each user can be a **member of multiple organizations** (via invite)
- No circular org membership (an org cannot be a member of another org)

### Organizations
- Created by a user (who becomes the admin)
- Has its own profile: org name, slug, description, logo (R2), banner (R2)
- Roles within an org: **admin**, **maintain**, **write**, **read**
- Admin can invite users, manage roles, manage collections, publish under org name
- Maintain can manage collections and members (except admin)
- Write can create/edit blogs and post to collections
- Read can only view org-internal content
- Org settings: visibility (public/private), default blog license, branding

### Collections (within Orgs)
- An org can have multiple collections (like folders/series)
- Each collection has: slug, name, description, cover image
- Blogs can be posted inside a collection or directly under the org
- Collection URL: `@orgname/collection-slug/blog-slug`

---

## 2. Blog / Post Model

### Blog Properties
- `id` (uuid), `slugid` (short shareable ID), `slug` (human-readable)
- `title`, `subtitle`, `page_emoji`, `content` (JSON block format for WYSIWYG)
- `cover_image` (R2 key), `tags[]`, `category`
- `author_id` (primary author), `co_authors[]` (array of user IDs)
- `published_as`: `"personal"` | `"org:<org_id>"` — determines context
- `collection_id`: nullable — if set, blog belongs to an org collection
- `status`: `draft` | `published` | `archived` | `unlisted`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `published_at`
- `read_time_minutes` (computed on save)
- `allow_comments`: boolean
- `license`: string (optional, inherits from org or user default)

### URL Structure
```
Reading:
  blogs.elixpo.com/@username/[slug]              — personal blog
  blogs.elixpo.com/@orgname/[slug]               — org blog (direct)
  blogs.elixpo.com/@orgname/[collection]/[slug]  — org blog in collection
  blogs.elixpo.com/[slugid]                      — short shareable link

Editing:
  blogs.elixpo.com/[slugid]/edit                 — edit any blog by slugid

Feed:
  blogs.elixpo.com/                              — root = feed
```

### Co-authoring
- Primary author creates the blog and invites co-authors by username
- Co-authors can edit content (via collaborative editor — see section 5)
- All co-authors are displayed on the published blog
- Only primary author can delete or change `published_as`

### Publishing Context
- **Personal**: blog appears on the user's profile at `@username/slug`
- **Organization**: blog appears on the org's page at `@orgname/slug`
- **Collection**: blog appears under `@orgname/collection/slug`
- A user can only publish under an org they are a member of (write+ role)

## 3. Authentication — Elixpo Accounts OAuth 2.0

Auth flow (per `login_plan.md`):

```
1. Frontend redirects to: https://accounts.elixpo.com/oauth/authorize
   ?response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=.../auth/callback&state=...&scope=openid profile email
2. Callback receives ?code=...&state=...
3. Worker exchanges code for tokens via POST /api/auth/token
4. Worker calls GET /api/auth/me with access_token to get user info
5. Worker creates a session (JWT stored in httpOnly cookie)
6. Refresh tokens rotated on each use (15min access, rotating refresh)
```

### Session Management (Worker)
- On successful OAuth callback, the Worker mints a session JWT (signed with a secret in Worker env)
- Session JWT stored in httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie
- Worker middleware validates session on protected routes
- Refresh logic: if access_token near expiry, use refresh_token to get new pair

### First-time Registration Flow
- After OAuth, if user has no LixBlogs profile in D1 → redirect to `/intro`
- User picks username (bloom filter check → D1 fallback if hit) and display name
- Profile row created in D1, bloom filter updated

---

## 4. Cloudflare Infrastructure

### Cloudflare Pages (Frontend)
- Next.js app deployed via `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`
- Static pages + edge SSR where needed
- Route structure matches `app/` directory

### Cloudflare Workers (API)
- All API routes under `/api/*`
- Handles auth, blog CRUD, user/org management, feed generation
- Bindings: D1 (database), R2 (media), KV (cache/sessions)

### D1 (SQLite Database)

```

### R2 (Media Storage)
- Bucket: `lixblogs-media`
- Key pattern: `users/{user_id}/avatar.webp`, `users/{user_id}/banner.webp`
- Org media: `orgs/{org_id}/logo.webp`, `orgs/{org_id}/banner.webp`
- Blog media: `blogs/{blog_id}/{filename}.webp`
- All images compressed to WebP server-side before storing (sharp or Worker-based)

### KV / Cache
- Session data (if not using JWT-only approach)
- Blog content cache (key: `blog:{slugid}`, TTL: 5min)
- User profile cache (key: `user:{username}`, TTL: 10min)
- Feed cache per user (key: `feed:{user_id}`, TTL: 2min)

---

## 5. Collaborative WYSIWYG Editor (Separate Plan)

- Notion-style block editor (e.g., Tiptap / BlockNote / custom)
- Real-time collaboration via Cloudflare Durable Objects or external CRDT service
- Block types: paragraph, heading, image, code, quote, callout, divider, embed, table
- Media uploads inline → R2
- Auto-save drafts every 30s
- Version history stored in D1 (snapshots)

---

## 6. Feed & Recommendation System

### Feed Algorithm
- User's feed = blend of:
  - Blogs from followed users/orgs (chronological weight)
  - Blogs matching user's read history tags (interest score)
  - Trending blogs (engagement velocity: likes + reads in last 24h)
  - Editorial / staff picks (manually curated flag on blog)

### Scoring Formula (simplified)
```
score = (recency_weight * time_decay)
      + (interest_weight * tag_overlap_with_history)
      + (engagement_weight * normalized_engagement)
      + (follow_weight * is_followed_author)
```

### Top Picks
- Curated by admin flag OR algorithmically: high engagement + high read completion rate
- Displayed in sidebar on `/feed`

### Implementation
- Worker cron (Cloudflare Cron Triggers) runs every 15min to pre-compute feeds
- Stores top 100 blog IDs per user in KV (`feed:{user_id}`)
- Client paginates from cached feed, falls back to real-time query if cache miss
